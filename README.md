# Climate and Lithuanian parliament elections 2024

## Introduction

In this work we aim to analyze climate data and review Lithuanian political parties proposals towards climate action.

The expected result of this work is to publish a single or series of publications in local media,  in order to raise the awareness about climate challenges.

To be continued.

## Technical side

We are here also to practice Python, DuckDB, dbt and potentially Apache Airflow.

- [ ] collect election programs
- [ ] analyze election programs (TSLKD, LSDP, Žalieji, ??)
